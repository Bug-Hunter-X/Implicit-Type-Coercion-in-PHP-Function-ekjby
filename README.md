This repository demonstrates an uncommon PHP bug related to implicit type coercion within a function containing multiple type checks. The function `my_function` attempts to handle null, array, and string inputs.  However, if the input type is not one of these, it falls through to the final `return $param;` statement, leading to potential unexpected results. This is because PHP does not explicitly throw an error for an undefined type or unexpected type in this case, it might implicitly cast to another type causing unexpected results. The solution demonstrates how to improve type checking and handle unexpected types using the `is_numeric` check and throwing a specific error for other cases. A detailed explanation is given in the bugSolution.php file.
